# Grid_Construction
Small code to create Helium Nanodroplets in brand new grids. The resulting outputs can be fed to the rotationl static optimization codes of our group. 

## Usage
Clone the repository and compile the file with ```make```. Make sure to change the variables that you want to use in the input. After that, the program can be executed via ```./grid_constr.x```.

The resulting file will not be readable (binary) but will be compatible to be used directly with the optimization calculations of the rotational relaxation codes.
